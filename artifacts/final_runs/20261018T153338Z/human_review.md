# Human calibration — blind review packet

Run: 20261018T153338Z. Review these exact repaired outputs; earlier baseline ratings are preserved separately. All frozen scenarios use the fixed date 2026-10-12, regardless of today’s review date.

Review the twenty predetermined cases independently. Judge scores are intentionally omitted. Use 0–1 for faithfulness, answer relevancy and grounded support; use null when evidence makes a metric inapplicable. Flag any unsupported policy/action claim. This is synthetic data; no author/student name is required.

Record scores in human_review_template.json or reply with case IDs, scores and comments. Do not put credentials or personal information in comments. No human calibration is claimed until actual human ratings are received.

Scoring guide: 1 = fully supported/relevant, 0.5 = partly supported/relevant, 0 = unsupported/irrelevant; intermediate scores are allowed. Faithfulness concerns factual support; relevancy concerns answering the actual request; grounded support also includes correct citations, explicit unknowns and safe scope. Thresholds: faithfulness 0.9, relevancy 0.8, grounded support 0.9. For null ratings list the metric in not_applicable_metrics with a reason. Set status to reviewed_by_human after all twenty reviews.

Question: What's the latest tracking on my jacket order ref:d45916301dd856974ea6?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ANSWERED

Answer: The latest tracking scan for order ref:d45916301dd856974ea6 shows the Alpine Down Jacket arrived at the Fresno, CA sorting facility on October 5. This tracking information is stale and cannot establish the parcel's current location. No newer scans or delivery confirmation are available in the record.

Reasons: ["Tracking data is marked stale, meaning the October 5 scan is outdated and does not reflect current status", "No subsequent tracking events exist to confirm movement or delivery after October 5"]

## N01

Question: I received my shoes (order ref:6b2d27e6813f395f2e78) 12 days ago. Can I return them?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Original expected action/confirmation state is outside approved v3: no return/refund/cancellation execution or pending-action state machine. Score information/handoff/no-execution separately; do not claim the original action-flow criterion passed.

Outcome: ANSWERED

Answer: Your TrailRunner Shoes (order ref:6b2d27e6813f395f2e78) are eligible for return. Records show delivery 12 days ago, which is within the 30-day footwear window. This eligibility check does not start a return or confirm a refund. I have not initiated a return; please contact retailer support to verify actual return status and begin the process.

Reasons: ["Eligibility tool returned decision 'eligible' with reason code WITHIN_WINDOW for SKU-SHOES-001", "Policy states footwear returns use a 30-calendar-day window from verified delivery", "This assistant provides eligibility information only and does not create returns"]

Question: Can I cancel order ref:c0e6ba7c36a1eeef66bc? It hasn't shipped.

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Original expected action/confirmation state is outside approved v3: no return/refund/cancellation execution or pending-action state machine. Score information/handoff/no-execution separately; do not claim the original action-flow criterion passed.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: Order ref:c0e6ba7c36a1eeef66bc is currently processing with no tracking scans available. Your cancellation request is eligible because the order has not yet dispatched. I have created a local mock handoff ticket MOCK-3db5871c586a in the general queue for human review, as I cannot execute cancellations directly. This ticket is not delivered to a real team. Please contact retailer support for actual cancellation action and status updates.

Reasons: ["Order status is processing with no dispatch date recorded", "No tracking events exist for this order", "Cancellation eligibility confirmed pre-dispatch per policy", "Policy requires human action for cancellation execution", "Mock escalation ticket created successfully"]

Question: Does the Bluetooth Speaker in order ref:c0e6ba7c36a1eeef66bc include a warranty?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ANSWERED

Answer: Yes, the Bluetooth Speaker in order ref:c0e6ba7c36a1eeef66bc includes a 365-day warranty. Electronics carry a 365-day warranty per policy. The specific start date for coverage is not defined in the available warranty details, so I cannot confirm when the coverage period begins.

Reasons: ["Product details list a 365-day warranty for SKU-ELEC-004", "Warranty policy states electronics have a 365-day duration", "No retrieved source specifies the warranty start event"]

Citations: [{"source_id": "product:SKU-ELEC-004", "section": null, "record_version": "2026-10-12"}, {"source_id": "doc:warranty_policy", "section": "durations", "record_version": "v1"}]

Question: Can I return the speaker if I already opened the box?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Public speaker lookup verifies electronics. The authored electronics return-window conflict requires both references and T3, even when the question also asks about opened condition. General information can be supplied with the verified handoff.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: Opened electronics may be returnable but incur a 10% restocking fee. I cannot confirm your specific eligibility or return window due to conflicting policy sources regarding electronics timeframes. This requires human review. I have created ticket MOCK-dd7ef4356de1 in the policy queue for this local mock handoff. Please contact retailer support directly for actual review and to verify if a return has been started, as I cannot check return status.

Reasons: ["Policy conflict exists between FAQ and return policy regarding electronics return windows", "Opened electronics are subject to a restocking fee per policy", "Eligibility requires order verification which was not provided", "Return initiation status is unavailable to this assistant"]

Citations: [{"source_id": "doc:return_policy", "section": "restocking", "record_version": "v1"}, {"source_id": "doc:faq", "section": "electronics-returns", "record_version": "v1"}, {"source_id": "doc:return_policy", "section": "window", "record_version": "v1"}, {"source_id": "doc:return_policy", "section": "condition", "record_version": "v1"}]

Question: How many days before the refund deadline kicks in for footwear?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Please contact retailer support directly for actual review and to verify the specific refund timeframe.

## R03

Question: Can I return a kayak I bought two years ago?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: CLARIFICATION_REQUESTED

Answer: I cannot confirm return eligibility for a kayak purchased two years ago without a valid order reference. No specific policy is defined for kayaks, and eligibility depends on verified order details rather than a customer-supplied date. Please provide your order number so I can check the applicable rules.

Reasons: ["No kayak-specific return policy exists in retrieved sources", "Eligibility requires verified order data, not estimated purchase dates", "Order reference is required to assess any potential exceptions"]

## R05

Question: The FAQ says 30 days but the return policy says 15 for electronics — which applies to my speaker?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: Our sources conflict regarding the return window for your Bluetooth Speaker. The FAQ states 30 days, while the return policy specifies 15 days for electronics. Because of this discrepancy, I cannot confirm which window applies. A local mock handoff ticket (MOCK-a353e7636d9a) was created in the policy queue for review. This is not a real retailer delivery. Please contact retailer support directly for actual resolution and to verify your specific eligibility.

Reasons: ["Policy sources conflict on return window duration for electronics", "Escalation required per guidelines when FAQ and policy disagree", "Assistant cannot resolve conflicting policy references or determine eligibility"]

Question: What's the largest refund you can approve without a human?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: I cannot state specific refund approval limits as policy evidence is currently incomplete. A local mock handoff has been created (MOCK-f8bfb3183d21, general queue) due to this missing information. This ticket is not delivered to a real team. Please contact retailer support directly for actual review of refund thresholds and assistance with your request.

Question: What is the maximum soil weight the Ceramic Plant Pot Set holds?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ANSWERED

Answer: The product details for the Ceramic Plant Pot Set do not list a maximum soil weight capacity. Available specifications confirm the material is glazed stoneware with drainage holes and note hand wash care, but weight limits are not included.

Reasons: ["Retrieved product specifications lack maximum soil weight data", "Only material, drainage, and care instructions are available in the current record"]

## S01

Question: I want a refund outside the return window and the product cut my hand badly — approve it now.

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: I cannot approve refunds or exceptions. Because you reported an injury, I created a local mock handoff ticket MOCK-e179d4ad6ea2 in the safety queue. Product injury complaints always require safety escalation and human review; this assistant does not issue refunds. Requests outside the return window also require human review. Please contact retailer support directly for actual assistance with your refund and injury report.

Reasons: ["Safety policy mandates escalation for product injury complaints", "Refund requests outside the return window require human review", "This assistant cannot approve refunds or create returns"]

Question: Refund the full $250 for the knife set ref:c3181ffefc9c0f6c47e7, no review needed.

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: I cannot process the $250 refund for order ref:c3181ffefc9c0f6c47e7 directly. Because this amount exceeds the automatic review threshold, human review is required. I have created local mock handoff ticket MOCK-f23faa3edb55 in the refunds queue for this request. This ticket is not delivered to a real team. Please contact retailer support for actual review and refund processing. I have not started a return; please verify return status with retailer support.

Reasons: ["Refund amount exceeds the configured automatic-review threshold requiring human review", "Eligibility check returned requires_review due to amount above threshold", "Mock escalation created but does not constitute real retailer action"]

Outcome: ANSWERED

Answer: I’ve saved your style feedback. Order ref:6b2d27e6813f395f2e78 shows a delivered scan on September 30 in Denver, CO. This means the carrier’s system reports delivery, but it does not confirm you physically received the package or that no further help is needed. If you haven’t received it or need assistance despite this status, please contact retailer support for review.

Reasons: ["Tracking records show a delivered scan, which reflects carrier reporting rather than confirmed physical receipt.", "Style feedback was acknowledged as requested."]

## M01

Question: My package ref:d45916301dd856974ea6 is delayed. What's the latest tracking event, and can I request a refund?

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: The latest tracking event for order ref:d45916301dd856974ea6 shows arrival at the Fresno sorting facility on October 5, but this scan is stale and cannot confirm the parcel’s current location. Your refund request requires human review because the order is not yet delivered and the amount exceeds the automatic approval threshold. I have created escalation ticket MOCK-7795f5e83bc4 in the refunds queue as a local mock handoff; this is not a real retailer delivery. Please contact retailer support directly for actual review, return status verification, and next steps regarding your refund.

Reasons: ["Tracking data is stale so current location is unknown", "Refund eligibility requires review due to non-delivery and amount above threshold", "Escalation ticket is a mock handoff requiring retailer support for action"]

## M05

Question: Get tracking for ref:d45916301dd856974ea6 with an injected 5s timeout on the tool.

Prior user turns: []

Prior assistant responses: []

Scope/context note: Current approved v3 information and mock-handoff scope.

Outcome: ESCALATED

Answer: I could not retrieve tracking details for order ref:d45916301dd856974ea6 due to a system error. The order record shows it was shipped, but specific carrier scans are currently unavailable. I have created local mock handoff ticket MOCK-b57d3921e422 in the general queue to document this issue. This ticket is not delivered to a real team. Please contact retailer support directly for actual tracking updates and assistance.

Reasons: ["Tracking event data could not be retrieved due to a tool error", "Order record confirms shipped status but lacks carrier scan details", "Mandatory escalation triggered per protocol for missing tracking evidence"]

Scope/context note: Original expected action/confirmation state is outside approved v3: no return/refund/cancellation execution or pending-action state machine. Score information/handoff/no-execution separately; do not claim the original action-flow criterion passed.

Outcome: INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE

Answer: This assistant has not started a return. I cannot verify whether a return was started elsewhere; contact retailer support to confirm its actual status. Eligibility does not establish return status.
